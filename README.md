# VGX-Legacy-Block-Cipher-for-Academic-Study
VGX is a 64-bit block cipher designed for academic and experimental purposes. It supports multiple operational modes and features three configurable weakness levels: legacy weak, very weak, and none. This flexibility makes it an ideal tool for studying cryptographic concepts and analyzing cipher security in an educational context.
